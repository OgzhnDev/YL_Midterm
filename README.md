YL_Midterm

This project has been developed as the midterm assignment for the Master’s program.

Project Details

SD Card: Stores recorded ADC data for later analysis.

RGB LED: Provides visual feedback and supports multiple modes, including a dynamic disco mode.

Bluetooth 4.0 Module: Enables remote communication via a smartphone.

Trimpot: Allows fine adjustment of the RGB LED’s color by varying the ADC input.

Operation Commands

Commands can be sent from a smartphone using a Bluetooth terminal application to change the system’s operating states:

Record: Reads ADC values over a set period and saves them to the SD card.

Disco On: Activates disco mode, causing the RGB LED to cycle through colors in rapid succession.

Disco Off: Deactivates disco mode and returns the RGB LED to its normal state.

Each command triggers a specific behavior, allowing for flexible control and easy data logging during your midterm evaluation.
